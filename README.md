## Installation

1. Open the Unity Package Manager window from the dropdown menu (Window -> Package Manager)

3. Paste `https://github.com/aashiqsworld/DSLT-Materials.git` into the text box and press "Add"

## Usage
After importing or updating this package, the shaders are automatically added as options to Unity's shader dropdown menu.

1. Create a material in the Unity editor.
2. Select the material asset, and click the shader dropdown menu at the top of the inspector.
3. Click the "DSLT" option and select the shader you'd like to use.

You can now edit the material properties and add texture references.

All files in Unity packages are read-only, so they cannot be changed. This includes shader graphs and sub-graphs. If you'd like to edit a file, make a duplicate and place it in the Assets folder.
